## Backup Plan: If Free Options Fail

**Scenario:** ReccoBeats shuts down, Essentia.js performance poor

**Action Plan:**
1. **Evaluate SoundNet Track Analysis API**
   - Check RapidAPI pricing page
   - Sign up for free tier (if available)
   - Test with 50 tracks
   - Calculate monthly cost projection

2. **Alternative: Soundcharts Free Tier**
   - Use 1,000 free requests strategically
   - Cache aggressively
   - Only analyze user's highest-rated tracks
   - Estimate: 1,000 requests = ~2-3 months of usage

3. **Alternative: Build Own ML Model**
   - Train TensorFlow.js model on Spotify dataset (if available)
   - Use transfer learning from Essentia.js models
   - Host model in app (no API calls)
   - **Time investment:** 20-40 hours (not recommended initially)

---

## Legal & Terms of Service Considerations

### ReccoBeats
- ✅ No TOS violations (public API)
- ⚠️ Check if attribution required (footer link)

### Essentia.js
- ✅ Open source (MIT-like license)
- ✅ Free for commercial use
- ✅ No attribution required (but recommended)

### Spotify Preview URLs
- ⚠️ Spotify TOS allows preview playback
- ⚠️ Workaround scraping may violate TOS (avoid if possible)
- ✅ Use official API preview URLs only

### Caching in Firebase
- ✅ Legal as long as data is for personal use
- ✅ Don't redistribute cached features publicly
- ✅ Respect original API TOS (no commercial resale)

---

## Conclusion

**Recommended Approach for "The List":**

✅ **Phase 1:** ReccoBeats API (primary source, free)
✅ **Phase 2:** Essentia.js (fallback, free, client-side)
✅ **Phase 3:** Firebase caching (reduce API calls by 70-90%)
